            <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <p>
                It's close to midnight<br>
                And something evil's lurking in the dark<br>
                Under the moonlight<br>
                You see a sight that almost stops your heart
            </p>
            <p>
                You try to scream<br>
                But terror takes the sound before you make it<br>
                You start to freeze<br>
                As horror looks you right between the eyes<br>
                You're paralyzed
            </p>
            <p>
                'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
                And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike<br>
                You know it's thriller, thriller night<br>
                You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh oh oh
            </p>
            <p>
                You hear the door slam<br>
                And realize there's nowhere left to run<br>
                You feel the cold hand<br>
                And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
            </p>
            <p>
                You close your eyes
                And hope that this is just imagination<br>
                Girl, but all the while<br>
                You hear the creature creepin' up behind<br>
                You're out of time
            </p>
            <p>
                'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br>
                There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl<br>
                Thriller, thriller night<br>
                You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight
            </p>
            <p>
                Night creatures call<br>
                And the dead start to walk in their masquerade<br>
                There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)<br>
                This is the end of your life, oh
            </p>
            <p>
                They're out to get you<br>
                There's demons closing in on every side<br>
                They will possess you<br>
                Unless you change that number on your dial
            </p>
            <p>
                Now is the time<br>
                For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah<br>
                All through the night<br>
                I'll save you from the terrors on the screen<br>
                I'll make you see
            </p>
            <p>
                That it's a thriller, thriller night<br>
                'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dre try<br>
                Thriller, thriller night<br>
                So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller<br>
                Chiller, thriller here tonight
            </p>
            <p>
                'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night<br>
                Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try<br>
                Thriller, thriller night<br>
                So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
                Darkness falls across the land<br>
                The midnight hour is close at hand<br>
                Creatures crawl in search of blood<br>
                To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood<br>
                And whosoever shall be found<br>
                Without the soul for getting down<br>
                Must stand and face the hounds of hell<br>
                And rot inside a corpse's shell
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
                Thriller, ohh baby (Thriller)<br>
                I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)<br>
                Thriller, all night, oh baby<br>
                I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
                Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)<br>
                I'm gonna thrill you tonight<br>
                Thriller, all night (oh baby)<br>
                Thriller night (Thriller night)
            </p>
            <p>
                The foulest stench is in the air<br>
                The funk of forty thousand years<br>
                And grizzly ghouls from every tomb<br>
                Are closing in to seal your doom<br>
                And though you fight to stay alive<br>
                Your body starts to shiver<br>
                For no mere mortal can resist<br>
                The evil of the thriller
            </p>

                <h3>How Thriller changed the music industry</h3>

                    <p><Strong>Thriller</Strong> sealed MTV's reputation as a new cultural force; dissolved racial barriers in the station's treatment of music (though MTV has always denied they existed); revolutionised music video production; spawned the "making of" genre of documentary ("The Making of Filler," as Landis said at the time); helped create a market for VHS rentals and sales, because fans were desperate to see it when they wanted, rather than at the will of TV stations; and, in 2009, became the first music video to be inducted into the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.</p>

                <h3>Exclusive: How Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' Changed The Music Business</h3>

                    <p>Made at a cost of <em>$1 million</em>-in 1983 dollars-<strong>"Thriller"</strong> was the first video shot by a film director, John Landis. "We were making most videos for $30,000-$40,000," McCarrell says. "I remember falling off my chair when I saw the budget."<br>
                    Although Jackson had become a fixture on MTV, the network found itself in serious competition from several other networks for the rights to show "Thriller," widely considered the most ambitious music video ever made. MTV ended up paying more than $1 million for the exclusive rights to air it, the first time it paid a label for a clip. "We owned the Movie Channel at the time and it bought movies exclusively," Garland says. "We used that as the template."</p>
